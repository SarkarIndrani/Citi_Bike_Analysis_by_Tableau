## Background
Citi Bike is a privately owned public bicycle sharing system, serving the New York City boroughs of Bronx, Manhattan, Queens, and Jersey City. It was designed for quick convenient trips to reduce emissions, road wear, collisions and transit congestion and to improve public health.
Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the <a href="https://citibikenyc.com/system-data">Citi Bike Data</a> webpage. 

I was asked to analyze last year's data from 1/1/2022 to 12/31/2022. After cleaning the data and I created charts and maps to analyze the data.

## Analysis
- I displayed the top and bottom bike station maps. Here I noticed that the most popular bike stations are near the waterfront, like Grove St Path, South Waterfront Walkway, Hobeken terminal etc.
- There are two groups of cyclists: those who purchase casual tickects, and others who purchase annual memberships. The bubble chart shows that docked bike is the least popular bike. I noticed annual members didn't use docked bikes but casual members did. The most popular bike is the classic bike. Users choice may have been influenced by factors like rental price, bike availability, and quality.
- The heat map displays the most busiest times to rent as 8:AM and 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM during weekdays. Not surprisingly, this matches the office time rush hours.
- We also see from the chart that number of rides per month is low during the winter months and much higher in summer. This makes sense as people may be preferring to stay indoors during the cold weather. The tourists during summer vacation time may also be contributing to be higher summer numbers.
